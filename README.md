# E7020E_Project

## Project Description

Our project purpose is to see whether a person is inside a perimeter or not. If the person is outside, a lamp on the board will light up.
This is going to be done with a MURATA board and a gps. We also have to implement a way to see the battery level. With the LoRa we are going to transmit the battery level, and if a user exits the perimeter, we are sending that users location.

## Higher grade

The group is aming for a higher grade than a basic pass. We are going to try to implement a charger of Lipo batteries, so that a user can charge a battery.
